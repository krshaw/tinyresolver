# tinyresolver
A small dns resolver made in Go

Made for learning. Don't use this.

Inspired by [How DNS Works](https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/) by Julia Evans, where a tiny DNS resolver is written in Python.

The resolver by Julia Evans uses an existing DNS packet parser, so I thought it would be interesting to write a DNS resolver in Go and write the DNS packet parser from scratch.
